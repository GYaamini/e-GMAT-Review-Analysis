*Verbal Section
*Data Analytics
*Price
*Live Sessions and Coach Connect
*Last Mile Push Program
*Question forums with prompt responses

Would make the product better:

*Some typos on verbal questions should be addressed
*Word Problems Section Hard question are much more difficult and time consuming than what is tested suggest to lower difficulty or mix in less difficult problems that can be completed in around three minutes compared to the excessive questions with four or five minute median solving times

I used e-GMAT to improve my GMAT score from 605 to 675, achieving Q87, V84, and DI80. The program’s modular study approach and data-driven analytics were standout features, enabling me to track my progress and feel in control throughout my preparation. I also appreciated the live sessions and weekly coffee chats, which broke the monotony of studying and kept me motivated with valuable tips.

After trying several prep companies’ free trials, I chose e-GMAT for its user-friendly, data-oriented interface. The course’s structured progression was especially helpful, starting with foundational skills and building up to timing efficiency. I began with the verbal section, improving from the 70th percentile to the 90th percentile in just three weeks—a remarkable feat given my past struggles with reading comprehension in exams like the SAT.

The program’s verbal-first approach provided a strong foundation that helped me tackle quantitative and data interpretation (DI) sections more effectively. The question analytics were another highlight, offering detailed insights on accuracy, timing, and score distributions. This feature allowed me to identify patterns in my mistakes and boosted my confidence when I saw that some challenging questions were difficult for others too.

While the course was transformative, certain sections—particularly word problems—felt excessively challenging. Although this built mental endurance and made actual exam questions easier, it also caused stress during preparation. I’d recommend students manage their expectations and remember that perfection isn’t always necessary.

Overall, e-GMAT provided a systematic, supportive, and effective approach to GMAT preparation. Its structured modules, detailed feedback, and engaging community played a key role in my improvement, equipping me with the skills and confidence to achieve my target score.",2024,November,"*verbal section

665 Q84 V81 DI84",5,110,Online Focused,Online,"Strengths:

1. Last Mile Program (LMP) & Mentorship
LMP assigned me a dedicated mentor who provided a customized study plan and personally tracked my progress throughout the journey. Honestly, having such a mentor made decision-making so much easier—thanks to her vast experience and clear guidance. She always knew where I needed to pivot and what to prioritize. That kind of mentorship is rare and extremely valuable.

2. Data Insights (DI) – High-Quality Content
e-GMAT’s DI module and question sets are excellent. The explanations are detailed, and the structure builds strong logical and analytical skills. Even on a bad test day, I was able to score an 84 in DI (97th percentile)—all thanks to their methods and practice questions. The content truly prepares you for anything the GMAT can throw at you.

3. Scholaranium – A Must-Have Tool
Scholaranium’s massive, high-quality question bank was one of the most useful tools in my prep. It made learning and practice much more effective. Without it, GMAT prep would’ve been extremely difficult. Plus, the performance analytics really help identify where you need to improve.

695 Q87 V85 DI82",5,200,Online 360,Online,"Strengths:

1. Adaptive preparation based on your strengths
2. lets you plan your time and schedule better - Especially for working professional
3. Structured approach for Verbal (ensures Conviction in marking answers)
4. Good focus on details in DI and Quants
4. Cementing phase - E-GMAT's Cementing (intermediate tests at topic level) and Error Logs
5. Sectional Mock
6. Final Mock Papers - You get 5 mock papers.

Would make the product better:

Could increase the number of Mock test papers from existing 5 to 10 papers.

I had purchased E-GMAT online 360. It had a time window of 4 months (you get option for 2 months or 6 months as well, based on your preference). There is also an option to extend your access in case you are not able to finish the course in the given time (with reasonable additional fees).
This course is a complete self learning course, without any live instructor. However, E-GMAT organises some of the live chat sessions with the instructors, to discuss some of the general matters around GMAT test prep.

Some of the key plus points are as follows:
1. Adaptive based on your strengths - Lets you skip the content in case you demonstrate 90%+ as starting capabilities in that topic. Saves lot of time along with maintaining the thorough approach.

2. Plan your time better - Good option where the work timings are not fixed. It gives you flexibility to manage your time. It also gave a proper study plan breaking down the topics and created day wise schedule for me to follow.

After signing in, I gave a starting capabilities mock paper and scored 435. Then, I started for the prep. Few key strengths that i can list down based on my experience are:

1. Structured approach for Verbal (ensures Conviction in marking answers) - Read carefully + Full understanding + Pre-think before looking at answer choices + focus on details + Evaluate and visualise answer choices. E-GMAT's this approach formed a pillar on getting answers right with full conviction.

2. Good focus on details - DI and Quant content makes you focus on small details / constraints. I started focussing on smaller hints / constraints / key words based on E-GMAT guidance. This helped me avoid lot of errors.

3. Cementing phase - These are intermediate tests at topic level. Re-call value for a learned topic increases significantly after doing cementing tests. There is enough pool of questions from which you get the questions in your cementing phase. So each time you give a cementing test, you encounter a different question, pushing you to use your brain in different ways.

4. Sectional Mock - Section mocks helped out in providing good base to analyse the topics where additional efforts were required. You get more than 10 sectional mocks for each section.

5. Building up Error Logs- E-GMAT gave detailed guidance on how to analyse the mistakes including evaluating correct but guessed answers. Building Error logs helped in last day revision of your mistakes and gives a closure before exam.

6. Final Mock Papers - You get 5 mock papers. Although, this felt to be low since you would want to take mock papers during your preparation as well. I had to eventually buy Mock Papers from Official GMAT (gave 4 tests for Official GMAT as well). E-GMAT's Mocks test in real stimulation. Difficulty levels of the questions are more or less in line with final GMAT exam.

Scholaranium Analytics:
This platform offers detailed performance analytics at a sub-skill level. You can pinpoint exactly which concept or question type is dragging your score down.

Responsive Mentorship Support:
Their mentorship program is hands-on—mentors track your progress, provide check-ins, and adjust your strategy based on data. This is a huge motivator, especially for working professionals.

Would make the product better:

A dynamic planner that adjusts based on weekly availability or learning pace could reduce overwhelm and keep prep aligned with real-life schedules.

Scoring a 725 on the GMAT wouldn’t have been possible without the structured mentorship and personalized guidance from E-GMAT. What stood out the most was their commitment to understanding my learning style and customizing the plan accordingly.

From pinpointing weak areas to helping me build a strategic, question-by-question approach—especially in Quant and Verbal—the mentors were always accessible, empathetic, and practical. Their prompt responses, regular check-ins, and data-driven feedback gave me clarity and confidence throughout the journey.

805 Q90 V90 DI90",5,110,Online 360,Online,"Strengths:

1. Coursework is structured and easy to understand on your own. It takes you from the basics all the way to advanced topics smoothly.

2. All progress in quantified and provided to you regularly, this way you can see how much you've been improving over time.

3. Lots of questions and practice mocks at a similar level of the actual GMAT exam for thorough preparation.

4. Self-paced content which provides accurate estimates of when you will be able to complete it all to plan in advanced properly.

5. Availability of an experienced mentors to provide direct and honest feedback

Would make the product better:

1. Logging errors for reviewing them later can be made a bit simpler and categorical, to ensure users can find all their previous errors in one place and review them at once.

I had been preparing for the GMAT for quite some time on my own, but didn't have a structured method or proper understanding of the concepts that are actually tested on the GMAT. After someone recommended e-GMAT, I gave it a go and was immediately impressed with what they have been able to put together. The courses for all 3 sections are very well structured and emphasize on strengthening core concepts instead of just solving questions mindlessly. This changed the way I was looking at verbal reasoning and enabled me to consistently score V80+.

I was mentored by Rashmi in the Last Mile Push (LMP) program, which is a customized plan for the last 4-5 weeks before the official exam. It was a great experience getting feedback from an experienced mentor about how to overcome some of the last-minute challenges and maintain consistency; and finally how to make sure you do your absolute best on the official exam.

My Takeaway
1. Build trust in structured processes, own them and stick to them on test day.
2. Practice consistently and challenge yourself with hard problems.
5. Manage your time effectively and learn to move-on. Getting stuck somewhere and wasting time is never the right choice.

685 Q87 V84 DI81",5,60,Online 360,Online,"Strengths:

After analyzing Melissa's interview, I can craft a comprehensive review of e-GMAT's GMAT preparation program. Her journey from 625 to 685 highlights several standout features that made e-GMAT particularly effective compared to other preparation options she had tried.
e-GMAT's Data Insights preparation stands out as exceptional in the GMAT prep landscape. What sets it apart is the realistic exam simulation that allows students to navigate through multiple tabs just like on the actual exam - a feature Melissa noted was missing from other preparation sites. The variety of question types provided in e-GMAT's Data Insights section is impressive, covering everything from tables with paragraph information to diverse chart types that other preparation platforms simply don't offer. This comprehensive approach to DI preparation gives students exposure to the full spectrum of question formats they might encounter on test day, eliminating unwelcome surprises.

Would make the product better:

The platform's quantitative section delivers questions with a higher difficulty level than what's found in official GMAT exams, which proved to be excellent preparation for Melissa. When facing the actual GMAT, she found the questions more manageable because she had already practiced with more challenging material. The targeted practice system allows students to zero in on specific topics they struggle with, rather than repeatedly covering material they've already mastered. This personalized approach to practice is more efficient and effective than the one-size-fits-all method used by many other preparation programs.

e-GMAT's mock exams provide a reliable indicator of performance and help identify areas for improvement. Though Melissa scored in the low 600s on most practice tests, the realistic testing environment and strategic guidance from her e-GMAT mentor helped her develop the mental resilience needed to push through difficult sections without giving up. The bookmarking strategy she learned proved invaluable, allowing her to flag challenging questions and return to them with a fresh perspective - a technique she successfully implemented on test day to maximize her score.
Perhaps most importantly, e-GMAT doesn't just focus on content knowledge, but also on developing the right test-taking mindset. Melissa emphasized that her mentality on exam day was the most critical factor in her success, and e-GMAT helped her cultivate that confidence.

After scoring a disappointing 615 on my initial mock test, I knew I needed a structured and comprehensive prep solution. After researching several options, I chose e-GMAT, and that decision made all the difference in my journey to a 735 score.
What sets e-GMAT apart is their data-driven approach to GMAT preparation. The PACE engine in the Quant section saved me over 50 hours of study time by accurately identifying which concepts I could skip and which needed attention. Their cementing quizzes helped solidify my understanding, improving both my accuracy and timing. Most impressively, their practice questions were often more challenging than the actual GMAT, which built my confidence and preparedness for test day.

Would make the product better:

The Verbal section was where e-GMAT truly shined. Their methodical approach to Critical Reasoning taught me the power of answer prediction (spending those crucial 15-20 seconds before looking at choices), transforming my approach to difficult questions. For Reading Comprehension, they taught strategic reading techniques that enhanced my focus and comprehension. By the end of my preparation, I was confidently eliminating incorrect options and consistently performing at a high level.

Even with limited time to prepare for Data Insights, e-GMAT's application files and comprehensive practice helped me master this challenging section. Their strategic advice on section ordering was particularly valuable—switching to attempting DI first in my practice tests immediately improved my score from 625 to 715 in just one day! Overall, e-GMAT provided more than just content—they offered a strategic roadmap to GMAT success. Their methodical approach, high-quality practice materials, and data analytics tools helped me identify and address my weaknesses efficiently. For anyone serious about achieving a 700+ GMAT score, I cannot recommend e-GMAT highly enough. The investment in their program returned dividends in my 120-point score improvement and has opened doors to top business schools that once seemed out of reach.",2025,May,"after scoring a disappointing 615 on my initial mock test, i knew i needed a structured and comprehensive prep solution. after researching several options, i chose e-gmat, and that decision made all the difference in my journey to a 735 score.

NA

As a Data Analytics consultant with over three years of experience, I recently scored a 705 (Q84, V84, D87) on the GMAT Focus Edition. A friend recommended eGMAT, and over the past year, I went from a 555 (49th percentile) in their SigmaX Mock to my final score. Here’s what made eGMAT invaluable to my journey:
1. Structured Learning Approach
eGMAT follows a regimented, three-stage learning process across all sections (Quant, Verbal, and Data Insights).
• Stage 1: Preparation – Concept Files (Video + Text material) explain key topics, followed by Guided Quizzes and Practice Quizzes to reinforce learning.
• Stage 2: Cementing – GMAT-like quizzes ensure mastery at medium and hard difficulty levels before advancing.
• Stage 3: Sectional Mocks – Full-length sectional tests help simulate exam conditions and refine weak areas.
The SigmaX Mocks are incredibly close to the actual GMAT in difficulty and scoring. Quant especially cannot be closer, making them excellent practice tools.
2. Exceptional Mentorship
The mentorship support was a game-changer. My mentor Dhruv Joshi:
• Helped plan, track, and adjust my preparation at every stage.
• Regularly checked in to ensure I stayed on track, even offering personalized advice when I got stuck.
• Provided mental support, advising when to take breaks or modify my study approach.
This one-on-one guidance ensured that I was never lost in my prep.
3. Course Material & Teaching Approach
eGMAT prioritizes methodical problem-solving over speed, which naturally leads to faster execution over time. Couple of things that gave a significant improvement in performance for me were:
• Quant: Focussing on extracting maximum information before solving, using simplifications and inferences for efficient problem-solving.
• Verbal: Starting with Master Comprehension, which teaches how to read strategically. Followed by Prethinking in CR / RC, emphasizing on complete understanding of the CR / RC passage over skimming through the content.
• Data Insights: Builds upon Quant & Verbal skills while introducing several other techniques. For example, additional mathematical shortcuts to handle quant-heavy questions across all question-types efficiently. This saves you from using calculator for each and every math-related question.

Verbal:
The Course and questions bank was good. Pre-Thinking the conclusions/assumptions was a helpful technique in some scenarios once the efficiency improved.

In some of the questions, the pre-thinking (and answers) of many students were different from the person who created the questions, but that's how English is (depends on the person's mindset)

Quant:
Helped in conceptual building (was my strong area anyways). the PACE system helped in skipping topics which reduced the overall time to complete Quant as well. Some logics and techniques were taught directly via questions in scholarinium (which can affect morale of some).

DI:
Sets were ample, Data Sufficiency question bank really helped in getting better scores.

655 Q90 V79 DI78",5,0,Online 360,Online,"Strengths:

e-GMAT's Pace Engine revolutionized my study approach by precisely identifying knowledge gaps and creating a personalized learning path. This intelligent system saved me approximately 25 hours by allowing me to skip familiar concepts while diving deeper into challenging areas. Rather than following a linear curriculum, the Pace Engine adapted to my strengths and weaknesses, particularly in Quant where I needed to focus on accuracy rather than formulas. The course structure moved systematically from fundamentals to advanced applications, ensuring I built a solid foundation before tackling more complex problems.

Would make the product better:

The Scholaranium question bank proved invaluable with its vast collection of practice questions stratified by difficulty level. This feature allowed me to progressively challenge myself from medium to hard questions across all topics. The platform's detailed analytics tracked my performance across all question types and difficulty levels, helping me identify patterns in my approach to different problem categories. Each question included comprehensive explanations and alternative solution approaches. The ability to create customized quizzes focusing on specific weaknesses helped me systematically address problem areas and steadily improve my accuracy rates.

e-GMAT's Pre-thinking methodology completely transformed my approach to Verbal questions, especially Critical Reasoning. The course taught me to analyze arguments systematically before reviewing answer choices, preventing the common mistake of jumping directly to options. For Reading Comprehension, the structured approach to passage analysis helped improve my retention and question-answering efficiency. The course's logical progression from CR to RC skillsets created a natural learning path, with each concept building upon previous lessons. The cementing quizzes reinforced these methodologies through targeted practice until they became second nature.
The SIGMA-X Mocks and Section Tests were crucial for simulating test conditions and building mental stamina. Unlike official practice tests that recycle questions, SIGMA-X Mocks provided fresh challenges with each attempt, preventing false confidence. The detailed post-test analytics highlighted specific weaknesses across all sections. Following my instructor's recommendation, I completed daily section tests in the final two weeks, which dramatically improved my test temperament. The personalized coaching support provided strategic guidance throughout my journey, with mentors available to clarify concepts and suggest targeted practice areas based on my performance data.",2025,March,"e-gmat's pace engine revolutionized my study approach by precisely identifying knowledge gaps and creating a personalized learning path. this intelligent system saved me approximately 25 hours by allowing me to skip familiar concepts while diving deeper into challenging areas. rather than following a linear curriculum, the pace engine adapted to my strengths and weaknesses, particularly in quant where i needed to focus on accuracy rather than formulas. the course structure moved systematically from fundamentals to advanced applications, ensuring i built a solid foundation before tackling more complex problems.","the scholaranium question bank proved invaluable with its vast collection of practice questions stratified by difficulty level. this feature allowed me to progressively challenge myself from medium to hard questions across all topics. the platform's detailed analytics tracked my performance across all question types and difficulty levels, helping me identify patterns in my approach to different problem categories. each question included comprehensive explanations and alternative solution approaches. the ability to create customized quizzes focusing on specific weaknesses helped me systematically address problem areas and steadily improve my accuracy rates.","e-gmat's pre-thinking methodology completely transformed my approach to verbal questions, especially critical reasoning. the course taught me to analyze arguments systematically before reviewing answer choices, preventing the common mistake of jumping directly to options. for reading comprehension, the structured approach to passage analysis helped improve my retention and question-answering efficiency. the course's logical progression from cr to rc skillsets created a natural learning path, with each concept building upon previous lessons. the cementing quizzes reinforced these methodologies through targeted practice until they became second nature.

I started my preparation with some old official guides and other books and soon realized it was extremely un-structured and not exhaustive in concepts and difficulty. I looked to subscribe to a GMAT preparation course and landed on e-gmat. My weaknesses were in verbal which I did very poorly on my mock test. In quants, my concepts were clear but I found myself succumbing to trap answers and silly mistakes. I started with building the fundamentals using the video courses on e-gmat followed by cementing quizzes on each concept. I first focused on accuracy and later improved timing. The support I got from the e-gmat team was incredible. They prepared a study plan specific to my strengths and weaknesses and also took into consideration my busy schedule. Abha was in constant touch and made sure I diagnose and fix my strategy when I faltered on tests. E-gmat’s recommendation to have a well defined error log helped especially towards the later stages of my preparation. Abha also helped me fill concept gaps that eventually helped me improve accuracy and timing. The next stage was being able to answer under time restrictions. For this, the e-gmat scholorium was the best tool. I was able to hone my test taking skills that significantly improved my ability to work within the time frame on the actual gmat exam. Followed by this, I tool 6 official mock exams scoring between 635-665. On the actual exam, I scored 665 (Q83, V84, DI82 – I also took the exam in this order). Two important tips for GMAT aspirants: A. try not to take too many mock exams right before the actual exam. B. try not to change the order of the sections on the final actual GMAT exam. C.

1. Extensive and exhaustive Content. Almost all question types are covered, and you can selectively practice your weak areas.
2. Well-written solutions. Very important in verbal. I particularly liked that most of the questions had written explanations because I could quickly go through those and not have to go through a long video.
3. Prompt responses to queries to questions and their solutions.
4. The best thing about the product – its sectional mocks. Plenty of sectional mocks for constantly testing yourself, while building the muscle to solve the section in the stipulated time.

Would make the product better:

1. While learning the course, the option of marking certain sections complete when you deem it so. Otherwise, the plan doesn't adjust accordingly. Either way, doesn't make a tangible difference to the prep journey.
2. To have written explanations of whatever few questions don't have that.

I had a good experience with e-gmat. Among the prep courses available, it is an affordable course and provides much of what is needed during the prep. I'll break up the review into sections, test practice, and the learning mentorship program.

Quant –
My quant was good to begin with, given my engineering background. However, I had a Q86 in my previous attempt. Certain improvements were required. I went through the entire course, tailored to my skill level. Helped me build confidence in sections I was slightly unsure of. The sectional mocks definitely help build muscle of tackling tough questions, which is something you don't get to practice in the OG full length mocks.

Verbal –
Major improvement here. From getting 5-6 wrong in RC to almost getting any wrong. In my 715 attempt, got all RC right, and 2 wrong in CR. Also, built a lot of confidence in Boldface CR too.

DI –
The question banks are pretty good. Good classification among sections, like verbal and quant sections of TPA, so helps in improving certain parts of the section. I believe there is still room for requirement, but I believe that is true for all prep courses since this section is still relatively new.

Sectional and Full-Length Mocks –
The sectional mocks are godsent. They help in multiple ways. Once, you have completed the course structure, the idea is to test your sectional prowess, figure out weak areas, work on them, and repeat the process. The sectional mocks were pretty good for this. Also, helps build the muscle to complete the section in time, although DI in the actual paper has gotten pretty tough and vague, so I believe they'll adapt there eventually.

Last Mile Push Program –
Got personalised mentorship from Rashmi. She helped me identify my weak areas and pushed me to improve on them before appearing for the exam. Helped me with test strategies, and how to draw meaningful learnings from poor performances, which helped a fair bit on the exam day.


My final thoughts are that if you want a major improvement in any/all of the sections, a prep course may prove instrumental, because OG has niether enough questions nor the testing environment needed (OG mocks are still very helpful). The e-gmat program is reasonably priced, covers all bases, and has a good question bank.",2025,March,"1. extensive and exhaustive content. almost all question types are covered, and you can selectively practice your weak areas.

2. to have written explanations of whatever few questions don't have that.","i had a good experience with e-gmat. among the prep courses available, it is an affordable course and provides much of what is needed during the prep. i'll break up the review into sections, test practice, and the learning mentorship program.

quant –
my quant was good to begin with, given my engineering background. however, i had a q86 in my previous attempt. certain improvements were required. i went through the entire course, tailored to my skill level. helped me build confidence in sections i was slightly unsure of. the sectional mocks definitely help build muscle of tackling tough questions, which is something you don't get to practice in the og full length mocks.

verbal –
major improvement here. from getting 5-6 wrong in rc to almost getting any wrong. in my 715 attempt, got all rc right, and 2 wrong in cr. also, built a lot of confidence in boldface cr too.

di –
the question banks are pretty good. good classification among sections, like verbal and quant sections of tpa, so helps in improving certain parts of the section. i believe there is still room for requirement, but i believe that is true for all prep courses since this section is still relatively new.

sectional and full-length mocks –
the sectional mocks are godsent. they help in multiple ways. once, you have completed the course structure, the idea is to test your sectional prowess, figure out weak areas, work on them, and repeat the process. the sectional mocks were pretty good for this. also, helps build the muscle to complete the section in time, although di in the actual paper has gotten pretty tough and vague, so i believe they'll adapt there eventually.

last mile push program –
got personalised mentorship from rashmi. she helped me identify my weak areas and pushed me to improve on them before appearing for the exam. helped me with test strategies, and how to draw meaningful learnings from poor performances, which helped a fair bit on the exam day.


my final thoughts are that if you want a major improvement in any/all of the sections, a prep course may prove instrumental, because og has niether enough questions nor the testing environment needed (og mocks are still very helpful). the e-gmat program is reasonably priced, covers all bases, and has a good question bank.",,h e a d e r s,"Online 360:

When I started with a 515 score, I needed a structured approach to GMAT preparation. e-GMAT provided me with a systematic learning path through their video lessons and practice modules.

Verbal Preparation

I found the verbal section particularly helpful. The pre-thinking methodology for Critical Reasoning took me time to master, but it became second nature after consistent practice.

Data Insights Experience
Their Data Insights modules were helpful, especially for Data Sufficiency questions. The ""Traps and Tricks"" section helped me achieve 90% accuracy in DS. However, I struggled with Multi-Source Reasoning despite their materials and had to develop my own strategies.

Platform Tools and Support
The analytics tools helped me track my progress effectively. I saw steady improvement in my mock scores, from 575 to 745 in practice tests. The structured approach helped me maintain consistency in my preparation.

Mock tests level can be improved to make closer to official Mocks

I think like anyone I would go with a product that is recommended by a friend or family or someone I know can trust on, that's why I joined a GMAT test prep course from another company in June, 2024. I prepared with them but could score only 635 in my first attempt in Oct, 2024. Its not that that company didn't prove to be helpful but it is when I joined e-gmat (being inspired by the results they advertised and student's interviews on youtube) and started my prep again, I saw how much e-gmat is advanced in terms of the quality of course they have structured on their platform.

I purchased a self-paced online course whose features were well suited was as since I didn't want to attend any live or classroom sessions. I knew that I had to fill my gaps in verbal (conceptual gap) not cor and data insights (conceptual gap + in-sufficient practice) - which as per one of the egmat senior team member - Sharddha mam's walkthrough of egmat platform was being covered in the plan I was going to enroll to.

Once I got onboarded, a coach was assigned to me (Rashmi mam) and she guided me in my prep journey. A few things imp for anyone who is starting their prep or is in the process and are looking for tips:

- Be consistent in your prep
(Measure how much time you are spending each day in studying. It used to happen to me that I would feel I have spent about 4 hours a day which was my goal but actually one day when I used online browser clock to get the analysis, I was surprised to know that it was merely 2-.5 hrs. P.S: most my time in studying spent on online learning)

- Build error-log (I didn't like registering my mistakes, I was lazy and I felt I will remember it but all of that was oversight at my end. One fine day I realized this because I was making repetitive mistakes. That's when I thought to myself that let me prepare these error logs for only those areas that are weak for me - CR, MSR, TPA. Although RC was also a weak area for me but I don't think error log was that much required for it. And believe me, revising these error logs frequently helped me a lot. I used egmat's error log templates. Their CR error log template may look overwhelming but I customized it for me to see the question type, mistake made and action items)

- CR Prethink -
(marketed by egmat but pay attention ""this is the way to go"" if you want to score really good in CR. And note this just a name given by egmat but is not something alien. Open GMAT OG, look at their CR solutions, they too teach exactly the same process. Initially you'll take some time in solving questions but if you keep on practice, you'll see the wonders happening. (P.S.: I've seen even Ron Purewell solve these questions in very similar style))

- RC improvement - follow egmat's way of reading the passage and the best arsenal to get to correct ans is eliminate options instead of going after the right answer. (While reading the passage - think of a third person or author reading that piece of info to you. This will help you understand where author's view is coming into play, what is crucial info and what are just details. Transition words are super imp)

- DI - Practice as much as you can.
(In my first attemo I didn't practiced enough and that was a bug mistake. So, make sure you do and solve the question you got wrong, multiple times even if you feel you know the logic. Egmat helped with the DI section especially to me because it has plethora of questions and also the concepts file for verbal MSR, TPA did wonders for me)

- lastly but most important - believe in yourself and take blessings of GOD each day
(Surround yourself with people who motivates you, fill you with positivity and who care for you. I always had this belief that I'm capable but still on my bad days the doubt used to creep in me but talking to my family and friends, helped me immensely)

P.S. Pardon the flow of the above review and all sort of grammatical mistakes. I just wanted to spend some time to write a honest review of how I'm grateful for the egmat team and also through this inspire some of the students/candidates who are in their journey to prepare for GMAT. No matter what medium you choose to prepare, I wish you all the very best! I know you'll achieve your dreams sooner or later. Cheers!",2025,January,"- course structure

the course really helped with mastering the concepts (which is the most important part), has great practice questions, and the perk i liked the most, a very great mock test exam.

i basically relied 100% on this platform, and it works. no other supplements, yes, not even the official guide book.

sounds crazy, but it works. of course if you're aiming much higher say 685+ you would have to put in more time, but considering only 2 months (less if you count in terms of effective studying time), i couldn't have asked for more!",,h e a d e r s,"Online Focused:

Hello GMAT Club community!

I’m excited to share my GMAT journey, culminating in a score of 685 (Q88, V83, D81), achieved through focused effort over 4 months and strategic guidance from e-GMAT’s Last Mile Push (LMP) program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Returning to academics after nearly two decades, I identified GMAT as the gateway to my aspirations. Initially, I joined a classroom-based coaching institute to re-establish a study routine. While Quant was my strength, I struggled with Verbal and Data Insights.
My initial strategy relied on strong Quant scores to compensate for weaknesses in other sections. However, a bad day in Quant revealed the limitations of this approach, as my composite score plateaued at 655 with significant risk of going downward depending on Quant performance. I realized I needed to improve Verbal (from V81) and Data Insights (from D76) to achieve my target.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turning Point: e-GMAT’s Last Mile Push (LMP) Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2024, I joined e-GMAT’s LMP program, with Rashmi as my mentor. She customized a focused 4-week plan. This plan was a game-changer, leading to at least 30-point score improvement in composite score on the back of 2-3 point improvement in Verbal Scaled score and upto 5 point improvement in DI Scaled score!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Contributions of e-GMAT’s LMP Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Verbal Reasoning Mastery
The structured coursework emphasized clear processes, particularly in Critical Reasoning (CR), where I struggled.
The pre-thinking approach and “Cementing” phase stabilized my Verbal scores at V83, boosting both confidence and predictability through a very data driven process.

2. Data Insights Improvement
e-GMAT’s resources helped me manage time and tackle diverse question types like MSRs, graphs, and tables.
Translating statements into equations for Data Sufficiency and Two-Part Analysis became second nature.

3. Mindset and Strategy
Rashmi’s honest feedback helped me prioritize pacing, avoid getting stuck on tough questions and focus on improvement areas.
My perspective on MSRs transformed from avoidance to confident tackling, thanks to her guidance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tips for GMAT Aspirants
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Build trust in structured processes, own them and stick to them on test day.
2. Practice consistently and challenge yourself with hard problems.
3. Focus on refining strategy and mental preparation in the final week.
4. Stay motivated, seek help when needed, and embrace course corrections. Remember in a long journey, there will be ups and downs.
5. Manage your time effectively and don’t dwell on questions that you are not able to tackle. Just move on.
6. Stay calm on test day, adapt to surprises, and treat each section afresh.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Takeaway
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e-GMAT’s methodical approach, combined with Rashmi’s mentorship, was instrumental in my success. Their focus on data-driven improvement and strategic preparation gave me the confidence and skills to achieve my goal.

Hi, I’m Abhrajit Ghosh, and this is my second attempt at the GMAT Focus Edition, which I took on 9th January 2025 and achieved a score of 695 (98th %ile). I have been studying for the GMAT for four years now. On my first attempt, I got a 645 on my own just using the OG material and free resources available on GMAT Club. But now when I look back, I realize that a 50-point improvement would not have been possible without dedicated guidance and a proper strategy. That’s where e-GMAT came into the picture.
After getting a 645, I continued working on my weak areas for another 2 months, after which I decided to try out the first sigma-x mock by e-GMAT. Based on my performance, I got enrolled in their Last Mile Push program, which proved to be the game changer. I was assigned a dedicated mentor from the very first day. She charted a detailed, customized study plan that included weekly milestones, provided in-depth analysis of my Scholaranium mocks in one-on-one meetings, and suggested ways to overcome my weaknesses. And most importantly, she always encouraged me to stay optimistic and have self-belief in the crunch moments. Practice makes you perfect, but e-GMAT showed me that not just practice but perfect practice helps achieve perfection.

The 3 most pivotal areas where e-GMAT helped me are as follows:
1. The curriculum is strategically designed to introduce basic topics that would act as the building blocks for the more complex and advanced topics, thus making it easier to navigate through the entire course. I have always been good at quant, so I was able to utilize their PACE learning option, which helped me filter out just the content I needed improvement on. The verbal course helped me fill in my conceptual gaps, and the video explanations enabled me to better visualize and apply the POE approach when I was left with the two closest answer choices. The data insights course helped me read the DI questions better to get an accurate understanding of what has been mentioned and what exactly the question is asking. So, even though this section is highly time-consuming, I was able to implement the strategies and some intuition while solving the questions, which helped me keep track of time.
2. Scholaranium has a vast pool of questions to practice from, starting from topic-wise cementing quizzes to sectional mocks to full-length sigma-x mocks. It provided me with a thorough analysis of my performance across the sections (from accuracy to timing), which helped me instantly pinpoint the areas I need to work on to improve my accuracy as well as bring down the time taken per question.
3. During the end of the preparation, I was able to revise and reflect on my mistakes with the help of custom quizzes that contained previously attempted incorrect questions. As a result, I was completely prepared on the DOs and DONTS for the actual exam.

A few tips I would like to share with future GMAT aspirants.
1. The Quant Section is generally harder in the actual exam than in the official mocks, so don't solely rely on the quality of questions you encounter in the official mocks. Practice harder questions so that you don't panic in the actual exam environment.
2. Practice the art of letting go. Don't beat yourself up; let the exam beat you. Learn to let go of the harder questions when you feel you have taken more than the time you should have taken to solve it. You can always come back and change the answer. That's one of the perks of GMAT Focus.
3. Time management is extremely important. Note down certain time intervals on your work pad so that you can check whether you are lagging or you're on pace with the allotted time.
4. Practice the mocks in different section orders to figure out the order that brings out your optimal performance. My 645 attempt was (V-Q-DI) whereas my 695 attempt was (Q-DI-V).
5. Official mocks 3 to 6 are harder than the first 2 free mocks. So they will provide you with a better indication of what your performance on the actual exam may look like. So use them very carefully.",2025,January,"1. elaborate and well-structured curriculum.

When I started my GMAT prep, I was stuck at 595 and had no idea how to move forward. I kept hitting a wall and felt like I’d reached my limit. That’s when I decided to give e-GMAT a shot and it completely changed how I approached the test. Their structured course and tools helped me improve my score to 665. Here’s what really stood out for me:

1. A Verbal Course That Works
The Verbal section was my weakest area, and e-GMAT helped me turn it around.
a) For Critical Reasoning, the pre-thinking technique taught me how to break down arguments logically and anticipate answers before looking at the options. This made tough questions feel much more manageable.
b) For Reading Comprehension, their active reading strategies taught me how to focus on key points in a passage, even when the content was dense or boring.
These methods really stuck with me and helped me gain confidence in Verbal, which was a huge shift from where I started.

2. Scholaranium Platform
Scholaranium is hands down one of the best parts of e-GMAT. The quality of questions is top-notch, they feel very similar to the real GMAT. The platform also gives detailed analytics, so you can clearly see where you’re struggling and where you’re improving.

a) For Verbal, it helped me master things like Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension by drilling into specific problem areas.
b) For Quant, the question bank was challenging, but it pushed me to improve my speed and accuracy.

The feedback from Scholaranium really helped me focus my efforts instead of wasting time on random practice.

3. Cementing Quizzes
The Cementing Quizzes were like the glue that brought everything together for me. These quizzes helped me practice under GMAT-like conditions and build the stamina and confidence I needed for test day. They weren’t just about practice—they were about making sure I fully understood the concepts and could apply them consistently.

The 1-1 mentorship provided in the Last Mile Program is something which stands out with e-GMAT. My mentor Rashmi helped me create an extensive improvement plan focusing on my weak areas which boosted my score to the level I wished. Moreover, they are always available to help and guide you where you feel demotivated and low.

If you’re struggling with the GMAT, I can’t recommend e-GMAT enough. It’s not just a collection of video lessons and quizzes—it’s a well-thought-out system designed to actually help you get better. Whether it’s Verbal, Quant, or just getting over a plateau, they’ve got you covered.

For anyone feeling stuck like I was, e-GMAT could be the thing that makes the difference.",2025,January,"good verbal course

The verbal prep is unparalled.
P.A.C.E. is a handy feature to save time.
On-demand experts' assistance is as advertised.

Would make the product better:

I feel the quant section needs to be re-evaluated.
The estimated course durations are not accurate.
The study plan set for me was far from realistic.

First and foremost, I would like to say that E-GMAT is by far the best platform I have used to learn and solidify concepts. This was especially helpful in the verbal section where I knew I struggled with the concepts and was in search of a guided framework which I developed through the duration of the course.
A little bit of background, I have, before this attempt, previously taken the GMAT classic, around a year before, in which I scored a 690 (classic). So when I took the free mock test on E-GMAT and got a 565, I knew a part of that was due to my rustiness with recalling the tricks of the trade and pacing.
I was looking to push my score beyond the 700 (classic) mark and was looking for the right platform to help me with this. From my past experience, TTP was too cumbersome and the OG question bank was too surface-level. Having seen some reviews and talking in person to the E-GMAT team, I was sold on the merits of the course.
On signing up, I was helped with setting up a personalized study plan (PSP), and here lies the first area of consideration. Ideally, I would have set my target at a 655 (maybe 20 points higher at a 675 at most), but I was ushered to push for a 695, and that's how the PSP was set. I know this isn't a bad thing, but given the fact that I was only 2 months away from my exam, I felt this was more than I should have committed to.
To begin with, the verbal course is excellent. Hands-down the best for CR and RC you will find on the internet today. There are certain instances where the practice questions don't really match the GMAT style, but I feel E-GMAT is the closest of all the others. Now, during the exam, I did get a lot more assumption-type of questions which I think was less of a direct focus in the verbal modules, but the framework that is ingrained takes care of all question types—so 100% recommended for verbal prep.
Now, the prep is longer than it is listed and I kept falling behind on my study plan. By the time I reached the quant section, I was already panicking because I spent 50% of my prep time just on verbal. The real problem however is that the quant section was not at all like the actual GMAT. It is way more difficult than it should be, and maybe this is intentional, but for me, I was not able to get through the course. After doing a few modules, I stopped using E-GMAT altogether and instead signed up for GMATCLUB question bank and focus tests. Do understand this my personal experience. If I had more time, I would probably have been able to get through the quant course and maybe score even higher.
I spent the last 20 days of my prep just doing practice tests and quant questions from GMATCLUB. Sometimes I would do a verbal test on E-GMAT. I also didn't do any DI prep apart from practice tests. My practice tests ranged 635-655 and I was happy with that and my actual score being a 695 was just the cherry on top (tip: take 2-3 days off before the actual exam).
Overall, I highly recommend E-GMAT for your preparation, BUT keep these points in mind:
1. Allocate more time than the study plan's estimate (pace yourself by 1.5X).
2. Quant course will really test you, so be ready for that (actual GMAT was a breeze compared to the prep).
3. Diversify your prep between a few sources as no one gets it a 100% right, but together (E-GMAT + GMATCLUB + OG) you are going to end up covering 99% of what will be there in the actual test.",2024,December,"the verbal prep is unparalled.

i spent the last 20 days of my prep just doing practice tests and quant questions from gmatclub. sometimes i would do a verbal test on e-gmat. i also didn't do any di prep apart from practice tests. my practice tests ranged 635-655 and i was happy with that and my actual score being a 695 was just the cherry on top (tip: take 2-3 days off before the actual exam).
overall, i highly recommend e-gmat for your preparation, but keep these points in mind:
1. allocate more time than the study plan's estimate (pace yourself by 1.5x).
2. quant course will really test you, so be ready for that (actual gmat was a breeze compared to the prep).
3. diversify your prep between a few sources as no one gets it a 100% right, but together (e-gmat + gmatclub + og) you are going to end up covering 99% of what will be there in the actual test.",,h e a d e r s,"Online 360:

I began with the verbal section, improving from the 70th percentile to the 90th percentile in just three weeks—a remarkable feat given my past struggles with reading comprehension in exams like the SAT.

The program’s verbal-first approach provided a strong foundation that helped me tackle quantitative and data interpretation (DI) sections more effectively. The question analytics were another highlight, offering detailed insights on accuracy, timing, and score distributions. This feature allowed me to identify patterns in my mistakes and boosted my confidence when I saw that some challenging questions were difficult for others too.

While the course was transformative, certain sections—particularly word problems—felt excessively challenging. Although this built mental endurance and made actual exam questions easier, it also caused stress during preparation. I’d recommend students manage their expectations and remember that perfection isn’t always necessary.

655 Q87 V79 DI82",5,140,Online Focused,Online,"As a working professional who improved from 515 (36th percentile) to 655 on the GMAT, I can confidently say e-GMAT played a pivotal role in my success. The platform's unique selling point is its data-driven approach to GMAT preparation, which became evident from day one of my journey.
The standout feature is their Pace Engine, which intelligently customized my study plan by skipping content I already knew while ensuring no knowledge gaps remained. This saved me over 41.5 hours of study time - crucial for a working professional. The quality of questions in their Scholaranium quiz portal is exceptional, matching the rigor of JEE Mains level problems. What sets these questions apart is the clear performance benchmarks they provide - 70% accuracy for medium questions and 60% for hard questions, giving students a concrete target to aim for.
Their Data Insights section deserves special mention. As someone who struggled with this new GMAT section, I found their comprehensive coverage of all question types (DS, GRT, MSR, TPA) incredibly helpful. The detailed video solutions for every question didn't just provide answers but taught better approaches to problem-solving. Additionally, their pre-thinking methodology for Critical Reasoning significantly improved my verbal performance, helping me achieve a V79 from V73.
The mentor support system is another strength. My mentor Dhruv provided consistent guidance through regular performance analysis, strategic advice, and quick responses to queries. What I particularly appreciated was the honest feedback about weaknesses - there was no sugar-coating, just actionable advice for improvement. The platform's analytics are impressive, offering detailed insights into performance across question types and an effective error logging system to track mistakes.
My sectional improvements speak for themselves - Quant from Q82 to Q87, Data Insights from DI73 to DI82 (93rd percentile), and Verbal from V73 to V79. These improvements came through structured learning, quality content, and strategic guidance. While the Coach Connect feature could be more structured, it's a minor concern in an otherwise excellent program.
What truly sets e-GMAT apart is how it helps develop both content knowledge and the right mindset for GMAT success. The platform's ability to identify and target specific weaknesses, rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach, makes it particularly effective.

- Customizable quizzes for targeted practice, allowing focus on specific weak areas and regular revision.
- Robust analytics that provide actionable insights into performance trends and weak areas.
- Dedicated mentorship through the Last Mile Push (LMP) program, offering personalized strategies and regular feedback.
- Prompt and reliable support from the e-GMAT team for any queries or concerns.

Would make the product better:

- Sigma-X Mock tests tend to feel more challenging and time-intensive than the actual GMAT, which can create a slight mismatch in expectations; aligning these mocks closer to the real exam would enhance their utility.
- Including shortcut methods alongside detailed solutions for Quant questions could help students solve problems faster during the actual exam.
- Some interface improvements could make navigation through the course modules more seamless.

When I started preparing for the GMAT two months ago, I was completely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content and the complexity of the test. As someone coming from a humanities background, the Quant section in particular felt like an insurmountable challenge. That’s when I decided to try e-GMAT, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made during my preparation journey.

Quant Section:
Numbers were never my strong suit, but e-GMAT’s methodical approach helped me overcome my fears. The course starts with foundational concepts, which are then reinforced through targeted practice questions and quizzes. The Scholaranium platform was particularly helpful, allowing me to focus on weaker topics like Geometry and Advanced Word Problems. Over time, I saw my accuracy in these areas climb from below 40% to over 80%, a transformation I never thought possible.

Verbal Section:
The Verbal section felt just as challenging initially, especially Sentence Correction. e-GMAT’s focus on breaking down grammar rules and teaching their application in a structured way made a huge difference. The pre-thinking strategy for Critical Reasoning was a revelation—it not only improved my speed but also helped me approach questions more confidently. Scholaranium’s detailed feedback and custom quizzes ensured I could drill down into specific problem types, like assumption-based questions, and improve systematically.

Data Insights Section:
The Data Insights section was entirely new to me, and I struggled to understand how to approach it effectively. The course broke it down into manageable subtopics and provided hard quizzes that helped me practice under exam-like conditions. Detailed performance analytics gave me insights into where I was falling short, and the mentors provided actionable advice on how to improve.

After three months of preparation, I scored 635 on my first attempt. While this was a solid start, I knew I could do better.

Final Results:
In my second attempt, I achieved a 685- a score I once thought was out of reach. The entire e-GMAT team was there every step of the way, offering timely advice and unwavering support. Their structured approach and focus on fundamentals were key to my success.

e-GMAT isn’t just a GMAT course—it’s a complete ecosystem that equips you with the tools, strategies, and support needed to succeed.

I started my GMAT prep 6 months ago after purchasing E-GMAT's Intensive Course and I can say that it was the catalyst, which helped me in getting a 675 score in the GMAT Focus edition.

The questions provided in the concept lessons as well as the ones tested in the quizzes and the mock tests are at a comparable (and sometimes above) the level of the actual GMAT exam, which also helped me understand the level of difficulty and the scoring system associated with the exam, helping me boost my confidence before the exam day.

I would appreciate it if they had a slightly more concise error-tracking mechanism, perhaps through text-based references v/s having to watch a video description of how to solve the question.

I started preparing for the GMAT, hoping to get a 90%ile+ across sections through self-study.

Things that stood out to me -

1.Dedicated Mentorship:

I was assigned a personal mentor, Rashmi, who helped me strategically plan milestones throughout my GMAT preparation to ensure I achieved the desired sub-section percentiles that would lead me to my target score. GMAT success is not just about mastering the subject but also about having a solid strategy and sticking to it. The team at e-GMAT is incredibly accessible, with doubts and questions being resolved within 24 hours.

2.Pre-thinking and Mastering Comprehension:

These two strategies were pivotal in helping me improve my Verbal Reasoning score from the 49th to the 94th percentile. While there are mixed opinions about the pre-thinking method, I found it highly effective. Pre-thinking forces you to fully grasp the passage before analyzing it, which improves comprehension. Moreover, it aids in eliminating incorrect options, guiding you toward the correct answer. Mastering Comprehension not only boosts performance in Verbal but also assists in Data Interpretation (DI) and Quantitative sections, where complex question stems often obscure simple underlying concepts.

3.Extensive Question Bank:
E-GMAT’s Scholaranium platform provides an ample selection of questions for both Quantitative and DI practice, particularly focusing on GI, TA, and MSR. Their structured approach encourages smarter problem-solving. By following e-GMAT’s methodologies, I felt far more confident tackling GI, TA, and MSR questions.

4.Balance with Official Material:
I recommend that test-takers complement e-GMAT’s materials with official GMAT questions to better simulate the actual test environment. While some of e-GMAT’s questions can be more difficult than what you may encounter on the GMAT, it’s crucial to use judgment in managing time during preparation.",2024,November,,,"my gmat journey started 3 months back after i had already attempted actual gmat with a 655 and a 49th percentile in verbal section. i knew i wanted to increase my verbal score and that’s when i came across the last mile push program (lmp) of e-gmat.

things that stood out to me -

1.dedicated mentorship:

i was assigned a personal mentor, rashmi, who helped me strategically plan milestones throughout my gmat preparation to ensure i achieved the desired sub-section percentiles that would lead me to my target score. gmat success is not just about mastering the subject but also about having a solid strategy and sticking to it. the team at e-gmat is incredibly accessible, with doubts and questions being resolved within 24 hours.

While I had tried various GMAT resources prior to subscribing to e-GMAT, none of them turned out to be as structured and content-rich as e-GMAT. It was through GMAT Club that I found and read great reviews about numerous test takers, and decided to enroll myself in a focused online course. Within a day I realized that I had made a great decision by doing so! The platform's easy-to-follow modules helped me strategize my preparation and break down complex sections into manageable areas, especially for the recently added section Data Insights. Thanks to the reading strategies provided by the platform, I was able to achieve a 100 percentile in Reading Comprehension. Furthermore, the analytics and cementing quizzes played a quintessential role in helping me realize and work upon my weak areas. Out of all the contributors, the greatest asset to me was the Last Mile Program, wherein I was assigned a mentor by the platform. As someone who deals with immense text anxiety, I can vouch for the fact that e-GMAT's Last Mile Program will not only act as an anchor and key strategy factor in your preparation, but will also infuse enough confidence in you to sail through this journey smoothly.

- Customized quizzes of all levels that helps build foundation, strengthen concepts, revise and do regular practices of any section or sub-section
- Personal guidance and support given through Last Mile Push (LMP) Program
- Very quick and prompt response from the whole team, whenever you need any help or have any query

Would make the product better:

- My only reservation is about the Sigma-X Mock tests as I found the questions to be much lengthier and tougher than actual GMAT Exam and Mocks. It'd be better if these mocks can be toned down which might give more of the real exam feeling.
- Also, it'd be better if you could provide shortcut solutions for Quant questions, wherever applicable, along with the usual lengthy ones.

Five months ago, I was a complete novice when it came to the GMAT. However, with e-GMAT’s structured study plan and timed curriculum, I was able to quickly and efficiently cover all the necessary topics. Their comprehensive approach eliminated the need for additional resources, saving me valuable time.

VERBAL Section - As a non-native English speaker with very limited reading habits, the GMAT Verbal section seemed like an insurmountable challenge. However, e-GMAT’s pre-thinking approach and extensive practice quizzes proved to be a lifeline. The course breaks down complex concepts into easily digestible steps, making the learning process as smooth as teaching a child. The numerous practice quizzes not only reinforced the concepts but also helped in building confidence and improving time management skills.

In my first attempt on October 4th, I secured a score of 645 (Q84, V81, D80). In order to improve my score in a short period, I got enrolled into the Last Mile Push (LMP) Program. This turned out be very helpful as I was assigned a dedicated mentor.
My mentor, Rida Shafeek, accurately identified my weak areas and provided tailored strategies to improve. Even though for a short period, she prepared detailed and target-oriented plan every alternate day, and helped me with analysis of my quiz results and suggested relevant improvement points.
I'd like to also thank Abha and Dhruv, who provided the required support whenever required. They were always available to answer questions and address doubts. Their guidance and support were invaluable.

All of them kept regular checks on me and suggested right strategies which proved instrumental in my success during the Second attempt, in which I could score 715 (Q86, V84, D86).

DATA INSIGHTS Section - Since scoring 80+ was a rare thing for me in the 15-20 mocks I had taken earlier, I believed there's nothing much left for me to do for DI and 82 is the maximum score possible. It was only because of the push given by these mentors that I worked on each sub-section of DI intensively and practiced more and more Hard quizzes. This helped me score D86 in the actual exam.

e-GMAT's focus on simplicity and clarity makes the learning process accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.

special thanks to my mentor abha for helping me throughout the process. starting from creating to study plan, identifying weak areas, suggesting corrective actions to sharing the tips for gmat exam day, she helped me in each and every stage of my preparation. there were multiple instances where i lost the track and focus, she encouraged me to keep the momentum and to have patience, her test-taking tips and tricks were invaluable. i would request every student to adhere to process and listen to your mentor. we sometimes feel that we know everything on our weak areas and what needs to be done. but instead of figuring out on our own, trust the process and suggestions provided by mentor. they have seen gmat journeys of various students and know what can help to get rid of obstacles.

695 Q88 V85 DI80",5,70,Online Focused,Online,"When I first began my GMAT prep in May 2024, I thought my self-study approach would be enough to reach my target score. But despite putting in consistent hours, my mock test scores were all over the place, ranging from 575 to 715. My first official attempt in July left me with a disappointing 625, and I genuinely questioned if I had it in me to crack this test. After a month-long break, I decided to give it another shot and signed up for the e-GMAT Last Mile Push (LMP) program in September, which proved to be a game-changer.

The structured approach offered by e-GMAT was exactly what I needed. From concept files to practice questions and cementing exercises, every step was designed to solidify my understanding of quant topics, and that progress naturally translated to data interpretation skills as well. I especially valued the focus on process skills—analyze, infer, conceptualize, and calculate. Being able to identify which step I faltered in when I got a question wrong allowed me to target my weaknesses and grow from my mistakes. Since GMAT quant revisits high school-level skills, having a solid refresher on these fundamentals was crucial for approaching more challenging problems.

Quant was always my weakest section. Coming from an engineering background, I was confident in my math abilities, but GMAT quant is a different beast. It wasn’t just about knowing the math but understanding how to perform under the pressure of time and accuracy. Through e-GMAT, I refined my strategy, ultimately improving from Q81 to Q88. The structured methods and focus on efficiency helped me build the confidence I needed to approach quant with a clear, timed strategy.

The Last Mile Push program was instrumental in helping me refine my approach for the final leg of prep. With the guidance of my coach, Rida, I learned how to target the last 20% of concepts and techniques that would drive the bulk of my score improvement. Rida's mentorship was invaluable; her insights and encouragement were a source of motivation that helped me focus on achieving a score I could be proud of.

In preparing for the GMAT, one of my biggest takeaways was the importance of rethinking my problem-solving approach. I realized I had been using thinking patterns that weren’t aligned with the demands of the test, and by learning to adapt my thought process, I could approach questions more effectively. This shift in mindset—paired with error logging, discipline, and a targeted strategy—ultimately showed me that, with the right tools and guidance, achieving a strong GMAT score is well within reach.

e-GMAT’s design, from concept building to test-taking strategy, is an exceptional resource for anyone willing to commit to the process.

I started my GMAT journey with a foundation in Quant and DI but recognized Verbal as my weakest section. After scoring 685 on e-GMAT’s free mock, I realized I needed focused improvement in DI and Verbal. I was particularly impressed by Payal Maam’s YouTube lessons, which led me to purchase the 2-month e-GMAT package to boost my DI skills before my test date.

In 20 days, I completed the DI module twice, practiced diligently, and significantly improved my score, achieving DI84 in my first attempt. Despite my strong DI, I recognized that more balanced practice across Verbal and Quant would enhance my score further. After consulting with Dhruv, I planned a second attempt, prioritizing Verbal without sacrificing my strengths in Quant and DI.

The Scholaranium platform, with its challenging questions, greatly prepared me for the actual GMAT. Official mocks felt noticeably easier after practicing with e-GMAT's Scholaranium, and I consistently scored between 755 to 775.

If I had one suggestion, it would be to ask them to provide extension at a discounted price :-)

If people are extending the course, it already means that they are going through a tough mental phase. A discounted price could ease their financial worries atleast a little bit. Provided that they still want to continue with eGMAT, I think an extension at a discounted price is a win-win.

As an engineer transitioning to management, I found e-GMAT to be the perfect solution for my GMAT preparation. The course's structure and personalized approach were instrumental in my 60-point improvement, from 615 to 675.
The PACE engine was a standout feature, saving me over 45 hours by customizing content based on my initial abilities. This allowed me to focus on areas that truly needed improvement, making my study time incredibly efficient.
e-GMAT's cementing quizzes were pivotal in solidifying my understanding across all sections. The Scholaranium platform's diverse question bank and detailed analytics helped me identify and address weak areas, particularly in Verbal and Data Insights.
The course's approach to Critical Reasoning, emphasizing pre-thinking, was transformative. It boosted my confidence in eliminating wrong options and significantly improved my accuracy on hard questions.
The Last Mile Push program provided invaluable structure and guidance. The personalized study plan and weekly mentorship calls kept me focused and accountable, which was crucial given my long preparation journey.
e-GMAT's mock tests were more challenging than the actual GMAT, preparing me for the worst-case scenario. The detailed post-mock analysis tools helped me refine my strategies and timing.
Even with limited time for Data Insights preparation, e-GMAT's comprehensive Quant and Verbal training enabled me to score well in this new section.
Overall, e-GMAT's data-driven approach, comprehensive content, and personalized support were key to my GMAT success.

->Incredible Mentor Support:
One of the best things about e-GMAT is the personalized mentor support. Right from the start, I had access to a dedicated mentor(Rashmi) who helped me build a study plan and keep me on track. I didn’t feel like I was prepping alone at all. Whenever I hit a roadblock, whether it was with the new Data Insights section or tough Critical Reasoning questions, she was there to guide me with specific strategies and resources.
She reviewed my progress regularly and gave me feedback on where I needed to improve, which kept me super motivated. The one-on-one sessions were really helpful in refining my approach to the GMAT Focus Edition’s shorter format and understanding the nuances of the new sections.

->Verbal Section Mastery:
e-GMAT is known for its verbal prep, and it totally lived up to the hype. They didn’t just throw a bunch of strategies at me but helped me apply them through personalized reviews and sessions. The ""pre-thinking"" approach to Critical Reasoning (CR) helped a lot thanks to the constant feedback I received.

They also gave me extra workshop videos and exercises in Reading Comprehension (RC) when I struggled with speed and comprehension, which helped me boost my accuracy for the Focus Edition’s condensed verbal section. Due to this, I was able to tackle even the trickiest questions with confidence.

->Solid Quant Prep:
e-GMAT’s course really helped me break down complex problems into easy steps. They cover all the key concepts like algebra, number properties, and word problems. Their video explanations were clear and easy to follow, and I didn’t feel the need to use any other quant resources.
Their AI-driven Pace Engine helped me save a lot of time while completing the quant module as it gave precise suggestions about portions to be left based on my strengths.
Really loved that feature.


->Help with Data Insights:
This was huge! The new Data Insights section combines data analysis, IR-type questions, and quant-heavy problems. It’s tricky, but e-GMAT added specific lessons and practice tests for this section. Their practice problems felt super close to what I faced on the real test. If you’re worried about Data Insights, their course will definitely help.
After getting a perfect DI score of DI90, I can safely say that their course is comprehensive and you would not need any other resource for your DI preparation.

->Scholaranium – The Best Part:
Scholaranium, their quiz and analytics platform, is probably my favorite feature. It helps you track your strengths and weaknesses and lets you customize quizzes. I could literally see where I was lagging and fix those issues before they became a bigger problem. The detailed stats on accuracy and timing were incredibly helpful for the shorter Focus Edition format.

Would make the product better:

Personally, I really don't have any recommendations for improvement. I was completely satisfied with each and every aspect of the course.
If I have to nitpick I would say their quant questions in mock were lengthier and tougher than those you would face in an actual GMAT exam. At times tough questions can lead to lower-than-expected scores in mock which can dent your confidence.

The E-GMAT course is an excellent resource for GMAT preparation, offering a structured and systematic approach to learning. It begins by covering the fundamentals of each section, then progresses to the ""Cementing"" phase, which helps solidify and apply the knowledge gained. The platform provides a broad range of questions, making it a comprehensive prep tool.

E-GMAT’s quick response to forum queries is extremely helpful for online learners, allowing them to resolve doubts either by browsing previous answers or posting new questions if needed. The platform's strong digital framework, including tools like Scholaranium, Sigma-X mocks, and others, enhances the learning experience with thorough practice and AI-driven insights.

I owe much of my GMAT success to E-GMAT’s Last Mile Push (LMP) program. I joined LMP in April, and under the guidance of my mentor, Rashmi, I was able to cross my target score. Her tailored study plans, regular check-ins, prompt resolution of doubts, and continuous improvement strategies based on my cementing and mock test results were key to boosting my confidence and performance.

All in all, the e-GMAT was a fantastic choice for prepping for the GMAT Focus Edition. Their structured approach and new content for Data Insights were exactly what I needed.

Personalization - Identifying strengths and weaknesses and planning accordingly.
Scholaranium - Question and Test Bank
LMP - Mentor Assistance

I had a 710 (89th - Q50 V35) on the Classic GMAT. I wanted an improvement in scores while applying to schools this year. I was considering multiple prep providers before zeroing in on e-GMAT. I think the pricing was better as well compared to the other courses I looked at.

One thing that I was definitely looking for was a structured approach to learning across sections, and glad to say I was pretty satisfied with what e-GMAT offered.
It starts off with a mock test to analyze your strengths and weaknesses - the learning plan is made accordingly. I also took the LMP Option as I thought it would be more focused and dedicated, with a mentor to guide me better.

Some context : At first, I was fairly confident on my Quant and DI, and thought I needed help only with verbal. But the mocks made me realize otherwise - after a couple of mocks, I found that my speed in DI was not good enough. And my plan was made accordingly as well.

I’d attribute my entire verbal score increase (74th to 94th percentile) to this course. I was able to learn almost all CR concepts and techniques to tackle both CR and RC questions through the video lessons. The cementing quizzes were particularly helpful in my verbal prep. My mentor Rida, also helped identify and prioritize specific focus areas in verbal.

i had a 710 (89th - q50 v35) on the classic gmat. i wanted an improvement in scores while applying to schools this year. i was considering multiple prep providers before zeroing in on e-gmat. i think the pricing was better as well compared to the other courses i looked at.

one thing that i was definitely looking for was a structured approach to learning across sections, and glad to say i was pretty satisfied with what e-gmat offered.
it starts off with a mock test to analyze your strengths and weaknesses - the learning plan is made accordingly. i also took the lmp option as i thought it would be more focused and dedicated, with a mentor to guide me better.

some context : at first, i was fairly confident on my quant and di, and thought i needed help only with verbal. but the mocks made me realize otherwise - after a couple of mocks, i found that my speed in di was not good enough. and my plan was made accordingly as well.

i’d attribute my entire verbal score increase (74th to 94th percentile) to this course. i was able to learn almost all cr concepts and techniques to tackle both cr and rc questions through the video lessons. the cementing quizzes were particularly helpful in my verbal prep. my mentor rida, also helped identify and prioritize specific focus areas in verbal.

- Scholaranium with excellent set of questions
- Course structure
- PACE platform which can adjust course completion timing based on pre-acquired skills
- Excellent mentor support

Would make the product better:

- The Error log can be too overwhelming and may lose bit of value for some students
- The number of questions can be increased (the more the better)

My name is Akhil Agrawal and I completed my first GMAT focus attempt on 20th September 2024 with a score of 685. I did my preparation through e-GMAT team. When I started my preparation, I had decent understanding of the Quant (because of my engineering back ground) but I lacked the ability to tackle verbal questions from their root. I did not have much familiarity with the Data Interpretation section. Additional hurdle for me was my rustiness in handling competitive exams after being not involved in one for 10 years. Quant being my strength helped me get a decent score in the test mock and I got enrolled into the Last Mile Push program of e-GMAT. This turned out be very helpful as I was assigned a dedicated mentor, who guided me throughout my GMAT journey. She prepared a detailed work plan, helped me with analysis of my quiz results and suggested relevant improvement points. Additionally, she kept regular checks on me and suggested right strategies which proved instrumental in my overall GMAT success.

The 3 most critical areas where e-GMAT team helped me are as follows:
- Solidify my conceptual ability in Verbal: Earlier, I used to rush while reading RCs (to save time) and never understood the how to tackle the reasoning in CR questions. The e-GMAT verbal course is designed beautifully from basics and provides the right tools to handle these challenges. I got good clarity in tackling CR questions and utilized effective reading strategies. This also gave me a boost of morale in Verbal, which I always considered as my weakness.
- Time managing and Exam sequence strategies – The median timings mentioned in solutions give a very nice reference point for start. However, each person needs to design his/her own strategy. One of my weaknesses was to get stuck on a question (especially in Quant) without letting it go. This was very detrimental for overall result. I will give a lot of credit to my e-GMAT mentor who pushed me hard to overcome this weakness. Additionally, she altered my exam sequence pattern which straight away gave me a boost of 20-30 points.
- Practice Quizzes & Mock exams – Scholaranium has really good quality questions. If utilized properly, it can help in robust preparation for the exam. The course is designed to first learn the concept and then cement them properly so they remain lasting without very regular practice as well. Additional feature of scholaranium is generating custom full section as well as topic-based quizzes with very good analysis. Overall Scholaranium is a great platform to practice and get prepared for GMAT.

I also utilized the GMAT focus section tests as well as the huge question bank on GMAT club for my preparation. A few tips that I would like to give to GMAT aspirants is that time management is very critical – my observation has been that leaving even a question un-attempted has a very big penalty which brings down the score drastically. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised how change of sequence of sections can also create a good difference in final GMAT score. Changing my usual pattern from Q-V-DI to Q-DI-V proved to be very helpful. Additionally, the free official mock tests on mba.com are quite simple in compared to the actual exam. So, be careful in judging yourself just based on the 2 free mock tests.",2024,September,"- scholaranium with excellent set of questions

1. Focused Approach
2. Questions similar to Actual GMAT
3. Interactive modules
4.Supportive experts

According to my experience, e-GMAT provides the best content to reach the desired score. The preparation flow is very focused and prepares for every type of question. When I decided to attempt the GMAT, I did a lot of research to find the best course, watched reviews on YouTube, read different opinions of people on GMAT Club, and so on. Acting on the collected data, I decided to go ahead with e-GMAT. The day I purchased the course, I gave my first mock test. It was a Sigma Mock by e-GMAT, and I scored 515. This was well below my expectations.
Based on the mock test, the study planner on e-GMAT prepared a study plan for me. My weakest topic was Critical Reasoning, which was dragging down my score in the Verbal section. After completing the Master Comprehension module, which was itself like a crash course of what we studied in school, I came across the Critical Reasoning module. The way it is structured is wonderful. Instead of videos, there are interactive modules, which are very helpful in understanding the approach. I found the Pre-Thinking concept especially helpful. The expert faculty of e-GMAT conduct lectures, too. There are concept files that teach you the topic, followed by practice modules, and my favorite, the GMAT Skills module. The questions in these modules are very similar to those on the GMAT. Further, The Scholaranium contains all the types of questions required according to difficulty levels. I created custom quizzes, too, to practice different types of questions.
I am strong in Quant, and hence it was not a problem for me in terms of concepts, but I struggled with silly mistakes. I improved my performance, but I still was not able to get all correct. For the Data Insights section, I found that the questions were very similar to the actual exam, making you less prone to surprises. With all the solid preparation and support from e-GMAT sessions and modules, after around two months, I gave my GMAT and scored a 625 (Q82, V82, DI 79). I was not satisfied with the score, as I wanted to score at least 645, which is equivalent to 700 on the GMAT Classic, and would put me in the competitive score category.
So, I decided to appear for the GMAT again. This time, I was offered to join the LMP program of e-GMAT. Ms.Rida Shafeek was assigned as my mentor. She analyzed my score report and assured me that my target score was indeed possible. She even said that I could score much higher than 645 and set my target score at 695. She prepared my study plan, keeping my weaknesses in focus. As I progressed, I could see that my performance was getting better. I gave the official mock and scored 695. I was very happy with that performance. After completing the study plan, I gave the final mock and scored 715. This reassured me that I was ready for the test.
Now comes the test day. I entered the testing room with a little nervousness, yet very confident. I chose the order as Quant-Verbal-Data Insights. I attempted the Quant section and was quite satisfied with my performance, and the same with Verbal. But then came the Data Insights section. Everything went fine up to the 12th question. There was an MSR set, and I could not understand it properly. I took so much time and still could not attempt the questions. I realized very late that I had wasted 15 minutes on that very set!
As soon as this realization set in, I tried to cover the remaining questions as fast as I could, but they were still taking time. I tried to go faster, but in the end, I had to just mark some questions and move on to avoid the penalty for missing questions.
I scored 645 (Q84, V84, DI78) in that attempt. Even though it was much lower than my expectations, I took a sigh of relief. If I had not wasted that much time on that one question, I could have scored higher. But I decided to go ahead with this score as I wanted to apply in the first round and could not give it another try.

675 Q86 V84 DI81",5,0,Online Focused,Online,"Context:
My first GMAT mock score was 505, and I knew that I would need a program, that would give me the necessary skill sets to reach the mountain top.
I knew my weakness is the VERBAL section, and was looking for a course that would help me gradually build up key skillsets and was affordable.
I shortlisted a couple of courses and tested a couple of them on their trial versions. Once I experienced e-gmat’s course I immediately knew it was the one. The course was structured, had a good reputation and was affordable. I even attended a couple of webinars held by Rajat and Payal and was immediately impressed.

For those who want quick tips / best practices for GMAT prep, I have listed my top 3 below:
Make sure to classify your errors in your error log and also any additional comments (such as Why did I falter or Why did I take so long or Correction Steps) should be as descriptive as possible.
Don’t worry if a strategy does not work for you, instead research for other strategies that best fit you.
Our brain works best in its most calm state, knowing how to get to that state is very important. For me, taking a deep breath for 5 seconds really helped me.
Be perfect in a section before moving to the next during preparation.
For those looking for details into my Preparation Strategy and D-Day Experience I have provided them below:

Preparation Strategy:
I prepared for GMAT in the following sections order one by one: VERBAL / QUANT / DI
I followed e-gmat’s detailed study plan, completed the cementing quizzes and also worked on the OG Questions before moving on to the next section.
A couple of tips from e-GMAT which really resonated with me were:

For Verbal:
Pre-thinking possible answers for RC Questions.
Mastering Reading Comprehension, by pausing at various points, to try to assimilate what that sentence meant and what is its relation with the content mentioned previously.
For Quant:
Making inferences of statements mentioned in the question stem.
For DI:
Understanding / Owning the dataset by taking small examples and making 1-2 observations
Calculating various values such as means, variance etc. from graphs quickly.

Post my preparation, I worked on my accuracy in e-gmat's scholaranium, trying to reach the 90% accuracy in medium questions and hard questions as well. Every mistake I made was logged in the Error log (provided by e-gmat) in a descriptive manner to truly understand what my mistake was.

I gave 10 Full length Mocks with different combinations of sectional orders, to see how my progress was and take the required steps to make any correction to my process, or mannerisms when writing the test. I noticed I was consistently doing well in QUANT, however, there were many peaks and valleys in my VERBAL and DI scores.

I realized I was taking too long to answer Verbal Questions especially CR which gave me very little time to complete questions in the end with good accuracy. For verbal, I created a document on the types of traps GMAT commonly used and was actively looking for these traps in the options. Similarly for DI, I realized I was taking too much time in answering MSR questions. To manage my time, I referred to the ""Timing Strategies page"" on the GMAT Club forum, and followed the processes mentioned in it. These changes in my strategy made very large improvements in my score.

My final 2 mocks I managed to score 655 and I found that my best results came when I attempted in QUANT-DI-VERBAL order. I felt the reason for this was QUANT was my best section, and it gave me the necessary boost to attempt the remaining sections with confidence. I kept VERBAL for last just after the 10 minute break, so as to avoid mental fatigue and bad decision making.

D-Day Experience:

On the day of my exam, I attempted a few easy questions, before giving the actual exam so as to get my confidence high and hit the ground with an active state of mind.

During the exam, I felt confident and calm. As I expected, QUANT went well for me, and I managed to get only 3 wrong answers. However, DI section hit me like a train, I felt that I was getting lost in thoughts and started taking longer than normal, after 5 questions I knew if I kept going in this manner my performance would not be good. So, I took 5 seconds, to recuperate my focus by taking a deep breath and got back into the game.
With this a switch turned on and I started answering questions more quickly and faster. Finally, I managed to get 15/20 questions right.

I took my 10-minute break and prepared myself for the VERBAL section mentally and physically. When I got back, I quickly created a grid to help me not look back at options I had rejected on solid grounds. After every 5 questions I would quickly review how my progress was and make sure necessary corrections were made in the next 5 questions. I knew I was lacking time to complete 4 questions in 5 minutes, so I randomly put 4 answers to, and I made sure to answer 3 out of 4 of these questions properly, by changing their answer post submission. Finally, I got 17/23 questions right.

I was elated when I saw my provisional score and I knew that it was time to celebrate. I want to thank everyone from the e-gmat team for their immense support and prompt attention to all my queries.",2024,September,,,"context:
my first gmat mock score was 505, and i knew that i would need a program, that would give me the necessary skill sets to reach the mountain top.
i knew my weakness is the verbal section, and was looking for a course that would help me gradually build up key skillsets and was affordable.
i shortlisted a couple of courses and tested a couple of them on their trial versions. once i experienced e-gmat’s course i immediately knew it was the one. the course was structured, had a good reputation and was affordable. i even attended a couple of webinars held by rajat and payal and was immediately impressed.

for those who want quick tips / best practices for gmat prep, i have listed my top 3 below:
make sure to classify your errors in your error log and also any additional comments (such as why did i falter or why did i take so long or correction steps) should be as descriptive as possible.
don’t worry if a strategy does not work for you, instead research for other strategies that best fit you.
our brain works best in its most calm state, knowing how to get to that state is very important. for me, taking a deep breath for 5 seconds really helped me.
be perfect in a section before moving to the next during preparation.
for those looking for details into my preparation strategy and d-day experience i have provided them below:

preparation strategy:
i prepared for gmat in the following sections order one by one: verbal / quant / di
i followed e-gmat’s detailed study plan, completed the cementing quizzes and also worked on the og questions before moving on to the next section.
a couple of tips from e-gmat which really resonated with me were:

for verbal:
pre-thinking possible answers for rc questions.
mastering reading comprehension, by pausing at various points, to try to assimilate what that sentence meant and what is its relation with the content mentioned previously.
for quant:
making inferences of statements mentioned in the question stem.
for di:
understanding / owning the dataset by taking small examples and making 1-2 observations
calculating various values such as means, variance etc. from graphs quickly.

- Some of the word problems are challenging and lengthy, requiring a significant amount of time to solve. This seems to discourage the students.

When I first considered preparing for the GMAT, I was concerned about the significant time and effort it would require, especially while working. However, a friend recommended the E-GMAT course and gave me confidence that it was achievable.
After enrolling in their basic course on June 2024, I gave a mock test to gauge my current level, scoring 555. Since then, I didn’t need to use any other materials or question banks for preparation. The amount of material and questions provided was more than enough. After 2.5 months, I was able to complete all the concept modules (Stage 1) and achieve the threshold scores in their cementing quizzes (Stage 2). This gave me the confidence to move on to the test readiness quizzes (Stage 3).
In the Test Readiness stage, my scores began to decline, and I struggled to identify my weak areas. I reached out to the E-GMAT support team for assistance, and Dhruv guided me throughout the process, helping me strengthen my weak areas. He also helped me in choosing an Exam Date as per my performance. Then came the final stage: Mock tests. Initially, I scored well (665 and 695), but some personal matters distracted me, and I lost my momentum with the subsequent attempts. As the exam date approached, I found more time for practice and got back on track. My final mock attempt scored 695, which really boosted my confidence.

1. The amount of detail in the course. This course alone is sufficient to cover all concepts needed to ace the exam
2. The number of problems available for practice
3. Similarity of questions to the real GMAT

The aspect of the course I really love is the amount of detail present in the course. If you can be patient ( Which you really need for GMAT ) and take the time to understand the processes and practices put in place this course is an absolute banger! It hits all the required aspects in Verbal, Quant and DI. The questions on the Scholaranium might feel they are slightly harder than the ones in the GMAT official book but trust me, once you get the hang of the principles mentioned in the course they will really help you a lot when actually applying the concepts on the GMAT and it will feel like a breeze. The number of questions you can practice on to apply the concepts you learn is insane. So if you take the time and mindfully practice, I can guarantee that it will improve your score a lot!

The platform is also simple to use and pretty straightforward. They walk you through the learning stages - like Cementing and Test Readiness so you are 100% sure that you know the concept, learnt the concept and can apply the concept. They walk you through prethinking for CR, reading strategies in Verbal, applying process skills in Quant and owning the dataset in DI, all of which I really found helpful in my GMAT exam.

I was part of the LMP program ( Last Mile Push Program ) where you are paired with a mentor who can motivate you, guide you on where you should be focusing your time and skills on and even help you in areas you are weak. This really pushed me when I was feeling down or couldn't gather enough motivation to finish my tasks.

Overall Tips if you plan on choosing the course:
1. Be Patient and follow through the course. This isn't a small course by any means. It is meant to take you to 99 percentile. And contrary to the saying ""Good things don't come in small packages""

2. Keep yourself motivated throughout the course. They have a system where if you get the questions right in the pre test of a concept, you are advised on what concepts you can skip. Take it up as a challenge and try to do your best and gamify your experience so it's interesting

3. If there is anyone you can rely on to push you to get that score, ( sometimes we all need that extra push ) don't be shy to reach out and ask the e-GMAT team for help. They will try and help you as much as they can.

4. The course is slightly expensive. So don't fall off the track. Keep the momentum going and try and complete the course within 4 months if possible.

4. the course is slightly expensive. so don't fall off the track. keep the momentum going and try and complete the course within 4 months if possible.

1. the amount of detail in the course. this course alone is sufficient to cover all concepts needed to ace the exam
2. the number of problems available for practice
3. similarity of questions to the real gmat

the aspect of the course i really love is the amount of detail present in the course. if you can be patient ( which you really need for gmat ) and take the time to understand the processes and practices put in place this course is an absolute banger! it hits all the required aspects in verbal, quant and di. the questions on the scholaranium might feel they are slightly harder than the ones in the gmat official book but trust me, once you get the hang of the principles mentioned in the course they will really help you a lot when actually applying the concepts on the gmat and it will feel like a breeze. the number of questions you can practice on to apply the concepts you learn is insane. so if you take the time and mindfully practice, i can guarantee that it will improve your score a lot!

the platform is also simple to use and pretty straightforward. they walk you through the learning stages - like cementing and test readiness so you are 100% sure that you know the concept, learnt the concept and can apply the concept. they walk you through prethinking for cr, reading strategies in verbal, applying process skills in quant and owning the dataset in di, all of which i really found helpful in my gmat exam.

i was part of the lmp program ( last mile push program ) where you are paired with a mentor who can motivate you, guide you on where you should be focusing your time and skills on and even help you in areas you are weak. this really pushed me when i was feeling down or couldn't gather enough motivation to finish my tasks.

overall tips if you plan on choosing the course:
1. be patient and follow through the course. this isn't a small course by any means. it is meant to take you to 99 percentile. and contrary to the saying ""good things don't come in small packages""

2. keep yourself motivated throughout the course. they have a system where if you get the questions right in the pre test of a concept, you are advised on what concepts you can skip. take it up as a challenge and try to do your best and gamify your experience so it's interesting

3. if there is anyone you can rely on to push you to get that score, ( sometimes we all need that extra push ) don't be shy to reach out and ask the e-gmat team for help. they will try and help you as much as they can.

The DI course modules can get better and more aligned with actual OG questions.

I started my GMAT preparation in January 2024. On a friend's advice, I registered myself for the egamt's Online 360 course. Before starting the course, I attempted a full length egmat mock and scored 425. Time management was the biggest concern for me. I realized I wasn't ready for this exam and needed a structured approach for my preparations.

I started doing all the module courses to get hold of the concepts in quant and verbal. I was doing decently well in the module tests and kept moving ahead in the course. In one of the module tests when my score was low, I decided to write a mail to egmat support to have a look, review my preparations and provide some feedback. Honestly speaking I didn't have many expectations from an online portal providing any sort of mentorship but decided to seek help just for the sake of it.

To my surprise, the reply that I received was very assuring and motivating. Hereon, egmat mentor Ms Rashmi Vaidya became a dedicated virtual mentor for me for the following months of my preparations. I moved places and relocated 3 times between January and April. This combined with the unpredictable nature of workload at a startup I would have weeks when I couldn't study even for an hour. But Rashmi and sometimes other mentors who would write to me would still be very patient and supportive.

By April 15 I had finally settled at one location and decided to study regularly aiming to take the exam around the end of June. During this time Rashmi gave me a reality check. Knowing concepts well just by covering the module courses was only 1/3rd of the preparations done for GMAT. She introduced me to the egmat idea of ‘cementing’ and ‘test readiness’ stages post finishing the online modules. The true importance of this I realized post my first attempt.

I completed all three stages for quant, did it partially for verbal and could not finish even the module courses for DI by end of June. I had fixed the exam date as 11th July. So, by end June I started giving official mocks and following were my scores

Mock 1 – 645 Q-84, V-80, DI-81.

Mock 2 – 595 Q-84, V-79, DI-76.

Mock 3 – 675 Q-86, V-83, DI-81

egmat mock - 595

I was having serious issues with time management in both verbal and DI. Invariably having to guess 5-6 questions in the end for both these sections in each mock. This was a result of not doing cementing and test readiness for those two sections.

The final exam was no different, I had time management issues in both verbal and DI. Guessed last 4 answers in verbal and 6/7 answers in DI.

Final exam score: 655 Q-87, V-80, DI-80.

I know the score isn’t exceptional, but it isn’t bad either. I can’t thank Rashmi enough for guiding me through this journey and being so patient with the erratic nature of my possible study schedules.
I must say if you take this online course and actually diligently complete all three stages of preparation on egmat portal, with the required score metrics, no force can stop you from getting an exceptionally high score at GMAT focus edition.",2024,September,"1. well structured.
